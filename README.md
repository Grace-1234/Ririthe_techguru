# Heart Prediction Model using SVM

This repository contains a heart prediction model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model is trained on a dataset of heart-related features and aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation of the model is the [Heart Disease UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type, among others, to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Requirements

To run the heart prediction model, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- scikit-learn (>= 0.24)
- pandas (>= 1.1)
- numpy (>= 1.19)
